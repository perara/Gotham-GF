GOTHAM - Game Framework
======
*GOTHAMGF* is a subproject of the Gotham - Global Online Traffic Hacking and Monitoring application.

The descision to build atop PIXI.JS was made after Phaser.JS did not meet the requirements of the project.

It started as a wrapper (and still is, kinda), but is now considered a game framework becuase of its multimedia capabilities.
